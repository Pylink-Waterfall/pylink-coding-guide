OOP is a powerful tool which we have access to when writing code in python. While we want to avoid overusing OOP paradigms on simple projects, if we are working on a more complex project it is best-practice to use OOP.

Before we start programming, we should try to design the overall, high-level structure of the project. Identify objects in the problem and then model their data and behaviours. Remember, objects are things that have both data and behaviour. If you are working only with data, you are often better off storing it in a list, set, dictionary or other Python data structure. On the other hand, if you are working only with behavior, and no stored data, a simple function is more suitable. Proficient Python programmers use built-in data structures unless (or until) there is an obvious need to define a class. There is no reason to add an extra level of abstraction if it doesn't help organize your code. On the other hand, the "obvious" need is not always self-evident.
