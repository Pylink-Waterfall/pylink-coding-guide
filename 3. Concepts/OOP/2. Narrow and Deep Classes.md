# Optimising your use of OOP
## Narrow and Deep Classes
As a general rule our classes should be "narrow and deep". This is to say that a class should have a limited (narrow) range of self explanitory public methods and should contain its complexity (depth) in internal methods (obscured from the API by using a leading underscore when naming the method).

For example, if we were making a class to represent making a cup of coffee we would only want an API user to have a narrow interface which lets them ask for a coffee and choose to add milk and sugar. They need not see all of the processes that it takes to make the coffee, nor should they try using them by themselves. See below for code representation:

```Python
class Cuppa:

    def make_cuppa(has_milk: bool=False, sugars: int=0):
        self._boil_water()
        self._add_coffee_to_cup()
        self._add_water()

        if has_milk is True:
            self._add_milk()
        
        for _ in range(sugars):
            self._add_sugar()

    def _boil_water():
        # process with code to boil water
        pass

    def _add_coffee_to_cup():
        # process to add coffee granules to cup
        pass

    def _pour_water():
        # process to pour water into cup
        pass

    def _add_milk():
        # process to add milk to cup
        pass

    def _add_sugar():
        # process to add 1 tsp sugar to cup
        pass
